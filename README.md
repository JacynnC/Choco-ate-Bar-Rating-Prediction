# Chocolate-Bar-Rating-Prediction
Second mini project
Chocolate is one of the most popular candies in the world. Each year, residents of the United States collectively eat more than 2.8 billion pounds. However, not all chocolate bars are created equal!

This dataset contains expert ratings of over 2,000 individual chocolate bars, along with information on their company made and location, percentage of cocoa, the variety of chocolate bean used and where the beans were grown, igredients added (cocoa butter, vanilla, lecithin, salt, sugar, sweetener), taste perceived and last but not least the ratings. The database is narrowly focused on plain dark chocolate to appreciate the flavors of the cacao when made into chocolate. The ratings do not reflect health benefits, social missions, or organic status.
